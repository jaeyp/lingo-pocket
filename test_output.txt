Maybe the widget is actually off-screen, or another widget is obscuring it, or the widget cannot receive pointer events.
Indeed, Offset(-272.0, 165.0) is outside the bounds of the root of the render tree, Size(800.0, 600.0).
The finder corresponds to this RenderBox: RenderParagraph#b4cf4 relayoutBoundary=up28

   Which: means one was found but none were expected

When the exception was thrown, this was the stack:
